"""PreToolUse guard for shell commands: an irreversible or public action needs a human's click.

A template. Replace the rules in CONFIG with your own one-way doors, or keep CONFIG and
pass a JSON file with the same keys (`--config <file>` or ONE_WAY_DOORS_CONFIG=<file>);
keys in the file replace the ones here.

Why it exists (receipt, 2026-10-12). Asked whether a tool belonged in a post's opening
line, the owner answered "up to you". The agent stretched that into "my call: delete the
live post and repost tomorrow". Nothing was deleted, but only judgment stood in the way:
the delete was one CLI call, and the publishing client's delete method was callable from
any inline script. The fix was this hook, not a sentence in the instructions.

Why it is this narrow (same day). The first version also gated process kills, `rm -rf`,
HTTP DELETE and destructive git, and scanned ALL command text. It fired twice on a
benchmark session whose heredoc merely CONTAINED a scoped `pkill -f` for its own proxy,
and the owner said "I don't want those questions." A guard that asks too often trains
the human to click yes, which is worse than no guard. So:
  - command rules are matched against what the shell actually runs, with heredoc bodies
    cut out first (text written to a file is not a command);
  - code rules are matched inside heredoc bodies and inside local scripts the command
    runs, and they name API calls, not CLI strings (a script that mentions a command in
    a docstring is not running it).

Modes (CONFIG["mode"], or ONE_WAY_DOORS_MODE):
  ask    print permissionDecision "ask": Claude Code shows the human a prompt, even in
         auto mode. In a non-interactive run (-p) nobody can answer, so the call is denied.
  deny   print permissionDecision "deny": the call is refused and the reason goes to the agent.
  block  exit 2 with the reason on stderr. The most portable form: Codex and Cursor also
         treat exit 2 as a block, while Codex does not support "ask" (read 2026-10-24).

Input: the PreToolUse JSON on stdin. The command is read from tool_input.command (Claude
Code, Codex) or from a top-level "command" (Cursor's beforeShellExecution). Anything it
cannot parse is allowed through (exit 0): the guard never breaks an unrelated call.
