"""PreToolUse guard for shell commands: never author a git commit with the wrong identity.

A template. Put the addresses that must never author a commit in CONFIG, or set
BLOCKED_GIT_EMAILS="a@example.com,b@example.com" (and optionally GIT_IDENTITY_HINT).
With no addresses configured it allows everything.

Why it exists (receipts, 2026-09 to 2026-10). An agent harness showed the owner's
sign-in address to the agent as "the user's email". On the code host, that address
belonged to a different account, so every commit the agent authored with it was
credited to the wrong person: three repositories, on 2026-09-07, 2026-10-02 and
2026-10-05. A commit, once pushed, cannot be re-credited without rewriting history.

What it blocks (exit 2, reason on stderr, which the agent reads):
  - the address set as an identity: `git config user.email`, `git -c user.email=`,
    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL= / GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL= / EMAIL=
  - the address passed as `--author` on a commit
What it allows: searching for the address (grep, git grep, `git log --author=`),
because finding where it was used is how you clean up after it.

Exit 2 is honored as a block by Claude Code, Codex and Cursor alike (read 2026-10-24).
Input: tool_input.command (Claude Code, Codex) or a top-level "command" (Cursor).
Test after every edit: python <skill dir>/scripts/test_hooks.py
