# clerk-production: receipts

Each heading is a rule from `SKILL.md`, with the case that taught it.

## Where Clerk's defaults or quickstarts contradict this skill, this skill wins.

- `Undated`: They were learned on Next.js (App Router, Next 16, where middleware is `proxy.ts`) + Clerk Core 3 (`@clerk/nextjs` v7) + Supabase + Netlify, building several products with coding agents. Among them were a live Q&A product with organizations, a moderator role and paid plans, and a monitoring product with paid plans and API tokens, named here only by kind.

## Authorization lives with the data, not in a path list.

- `2026-08-27`, building the first slice with sign-in and data.

## Never attach a feature to a Clerk permission.

- `2026-09-03`, building plans for a live Q&A product.

## Clerk's wording is not part of your contract.

- `2026-09-20`, a vendor rewording broke six specs at once.

## Read the gotchas before touching Clerk.

- `Undated`: Each failed silently, or looked like a different problem, the first time.

## The agent can make three setup changes through the Backend API.

- `2026-10-31`, an evals product made all three this way while its owner was away from the machine.

## A screenshot records intended configuration, not the live value.

- `2026-10-21` to `2026-10-24`, a monitoring product recorded its organization, sign-in and OAuth settings on both instances as read-backs.

## Apply these OAuth settings only for a member-authenticated MCP server.

- `2026-10-06`, a live Q&A product's MCP OAuth stage, development and production. Every setting failed silently, or would have, the first time.

## Create no OAuth application by hand.

- `2026-10-27`, after ChatGPT signed in by CIMD, the Backend API's `GET /v1/oauth_applications` listed none; the dashboard was not checked.

## An instance cloned from development does not carry these settings.

- `2026-10-24`, a production instance made from development's settings had DCR, CIMD and `aud_claim_enabled` off and no default scopes.

## Discovery's `claims_supported` is not the shape of the JWT Clerk emits.

- `Undated`: A real grant carried `client_id` and `scope`, which the list omits.
