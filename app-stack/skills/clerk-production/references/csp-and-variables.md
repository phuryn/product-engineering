## The CSP header

Every app needs a CSP header (`saas-authorization § Untrusted text`). This is how it is made on this stack. **The nonce policy comes from Clerk's middleware, never from a hand-written one.** The middleware writes a policy Clerk's own scripts satisfy, while a hand-written policy has to keep up with every origin Clerk's sign-in loads from.

- **In `src/proxy.ts`:**

  ```ts
  clerkMiddleware(handler, {
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      strict: true,
      directives: {
        "frame-ancestors": ["'none'"],
        "object-src": ["'none'"],
        "base-uri": ["'self'"],
        "img-src": ["'self'", "data:"],
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  - Clerk merges these directives into its own rather than replacing them.
  - **`img-src data:` is there for Clerk itself.** `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` draw a `data:` SVG, which the default policy refused with a console error on every visit (`2026-10-22`). A browser test loads sign-in and sign-up and fails on any CSP refusal.
  - `strict: true` issues a per-request nonce with `'strict-dynamic'`.
  - Next's own scripts carry the nonce too, because the policy is also set on the request headers Next reads.
  - A nonce needs dynamic rendering, which live pages already have. That is also why `/` renders per request (`sessions-and-front-door.md § The front door and the member home`).
- **A third-party origin joins the directives only once its integration is wired.** For example, cookieless Microsoft Clarity adds `connect-src https://*.clarity.ms` and `img-src data: https://*.clarity.ms https://c.bing.com` once a project id is set.
- **The static headers go in `next.config.ts` `headers()`, on `/:path*`:**
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`;
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin`, so no page, same-origin or not, hands its path and query (an id, an invitation ticket) to the next; never `no-referrer`, which makes the browser send `Origin: null` (`saas-authorization`, threat model);
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.
- **A surface that must be framed gets its own policy and its own branch in the proxy**, never a hole in the general one.
- **Prove it on a raw response**, on `/` and on a page reached by an id: `content-security-policy` contains `frame-ancestors 'none'` and `'nonce-`, two requests get different nonces, and `referrer-policy` is `strict-origin`.

Receipts:

- `2026-09-15`, a production-readiness review found no CSP or `X-Frame-Options` header on a live Q&A product's production.
- A later product on the same stack deferred its CSP, believing Clerk's scripts needed a nonce-aware policy someone would have to write. The middleware *is* that policy.

**What the middleware costs:** it runs on `/` too, so a browser with an expired session token gets a refresh or a handshake redirect before any page renders, even a page that reads no session. Only a page outside the middleware avoids that, and such a page loses the nonce policy (`gotchas.md`).

## Variables

| Name | Used by | Scope | Source | Risk if leaked |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | ClerkJS in the browser. Needed at **build** time, because it is compiled into the bundle. Must be the `pk_…` key: the env schema refuses an `sk_…` value here, at build | client | Clerk → *API keys* | low (public by design) |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | verifying sessions; the Backend API; verifying MCP OAuth tokens | server | Clerk → *API keys*, rotated in the dashboard | **critical**: impersonation |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` | the server's sign-in redirect (`auth().redirectToSignIn()`, `auth.protect()`), which does not read the provider's `signInUrl` | client | you: `/sign-in` | none |
| `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | verifying webhook signatures. Only once the personal-data trigger fires; empty until then | server | Clerk → *Webhooks* | high: forged deletions |
| `TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL` | **tests only**: the account the authenticated suite signs in as. Must carry the `+clerk_test` subaddress; every further test account is derived from it. Not in the app's env schema | test | you (any address, as long as it is `+clerk_test`) | none: Clerk never sends mail to it |
| `TEST_VERIFICATION_CODE` | **tests only**: the code a **development** instance with Test mode on accepts for every `+clerk_test` address (`424242` unless changed, and it should be changed) | test | Clerk → *Configure → Instance → Test mode* | none on its own, but it is the password to every test account on the instance |

**The env schema's Clerk checks.** The general contract is in `environments`. It runs from `next.config.ts` at build and dev start, treats an empty value as unset, and lists every problem without echoing a value. The Clerk half:

- **Each key's shape is checked:** `pk_(test|live)_` for the publishable key and `sk_(test|live)_` for the secret.
- **Every `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` key refuses a secret-shaped value.** A unit test pins the refusal, and pins that the message does not contain the secret.
- **Why at build, not at boot:** a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` value is inlined into the client bundle when the build runs, and static chunks are served without any per-request check. A boot check comes after the leak.
- **A host that scopes secrets away from the build** (Netlify's variable scopes) still gets the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` half validated at build. The server-only remainder is checked at boot.

**The secret key fits in the publishable variable, and nothing in Clerk or Next refuses it.**

- Both keys sit side by side on the *API keys* page, and `.env` is filled by hand.
- An `sk_…` pasted into `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is inlined into every client chunk at build, and served by `next dev`.
- ClerkJS's *invalid publishable key* comes only after the bundle exists.
- If only the secret is at hand, a development publishable key is `pk_test_` + base64 of `<frontend-api-host>$`. Confirm the instance from `https://<frontend-api-host>/v1/environment`.
- **If a build or a dev server ever ran with the secret in the public variable, rotate it.**
- (`2026-10-10`, a product's `.env` held the secret in both variables; caught before anything was built with it.)

**MCP OAuth needs no new variable:** the publishable key gives the issuer, the secret key verifies tokens, and `APP_URL` gives the resource (`SKILL.md § MCP OAuth`).

## What to record about Clerk

In the product's integration notes, kept current, dated:

- **The instances:** development keys locally, a production instance for the deploy.
- **The components in use**: `<SignIn />`, `<SignUp />`, `<UserButton />`, and as the shape uses them `<OrganizationSwitcher />`, `<PricingTable />` and the organization modal. Note that they are dressed through `appearance.variables` referencing the kit's tokens.
- **The workspace model.** In the organization shape, organizations on with *Membership required*. In the individual shape, organizations off.
- **In the organization shape, the roles on the instance** and what each maps to in the permission module.
- **With Clerk Billing:**
  - which billing tab the plans live in, the one matching the workspace model (the tabs are permanent);
  - the billing file, the exact feature slugs the code gates on with the plan each belongs to, and each instance's read-back against the file, dated (`organizations-and-billing.md § Billing`);
  - which roles hold *Manage billing*.
- **That no feature is attached to a Clerk permission.**
- **The test accounts** the authenticated suite creates: one per role, in one organization.
- **The webhooks consumed**: none until the personal-data trigger, and Clerk's own deletion paths off until then.
- **The cookies Clerk sets, signed-out visitors included.** With the provider in the root layout, a signed-out visit to any page ends with `__client_uat` (and, on a development instance, `__clerk_db_jwt`), each also under a suffixed name, on your host, plus Cloudflare's `__cf_bm` and `_cfuvid` on Clerk's frontend API host. The privacy page names them. (`2026-10-22`, measured on a signed-out visit to a legal page.)
- **The MCP OAuth re-read**, per instance, when the product is an MCP server.
- **The production instance's email DNS records and the legal-consent setting**, confirmed by a person.
- **A dated read-back of each dashboard setting**, or a screenshot where nothing can read it (`SKILL.md § Keep a record of every dashboard setting`).

## The production instance

At go-live, as part of production resources kept separate from development (`release-gate`, `environments`), the production instance gets:

- **its own keys**, none shared with development. **They work only on the domains the instance is configured for**: a production site that also answers on the host's default subdomain refuses sign-in there (`2026-10-24`);
- **its DNS records** (`clerk.`, `accounts.`, `clkmail.` and two DKIM CNAMEs), DNS-only, with the sign-in host watched by the external monitor (`gotchas.md`);
- **its own OAuth client for each social sign-in.** A development instance signs in with Google on Clerk's shared credentials; production needs a client in your own Google Cloud project, its id and secret entered in Clerk. To rotate its secret: make a new one in the client, paste it into Clerk, then delete the old (`2026-10-24`);
- ***Require express consent to legal documents*** on at sign-up, with the legal pages' URLs. The legal pages land before the first stranger is asked for anything, and every sentence on them is checked against what runs today;
- **a real Stripe account connected to Clerk Billing**, when the product bills, in the dashboard. Its plans come from the same billing file, applied with `--instance prod` after a dry run and read back (`organizations-and-billing.md § Billing`);
- **every other dashboard setting applied again and read back**: organizations and *Membership required*, roles and *Manage billing*, the deletion switches, the OAuth settings. **An instance cloned from development does not carry the settings that only the API sets**: production's OAuth settings came across with DCR, CIMD and the audience claim off and no default scopes (`2026-10-24`);
- **generated secrets generated afresh**, never copied from development. Each dashboard change gets its screenshot.

**Once a production branch exists, the product branch never builds with production's values.** On Netlify, either give its branch deploy context the development values (deploy contexts exist on every plan; the *scopes* Builds, Functions and the rest are Pro and Enterprise only, read `2026-10-25` in Netlify's environment-variable docs), or build it on a development site of its own, as a monitoring product did (`2026-10-23`). Otherwise it starts writing to production. The pattern is `environments`.
