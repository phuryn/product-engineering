# Clerk in production: the choices its own skills cannot make

**Decide the product's access model before following Clerk's API guidance.** Clerk's own agent skills know the API. They cannot decide:

- where a session is verified, and what may read it;
- what a workspace is;
- where billing ends and authorization begins;
- which dashboard settings silently change what your code is allowed to do.

Those decisions are here.

**Where Clerk's defaults or quickstarts contradict this skill, this skill wins.** These mechanics use Next.js App Router, Next 16 (`proxy.ts` middleware), Clerk Core 3 (`@clerk/nextjs` v7), Supabase and Netlify. Apply `saas-authorization` for the access model, which carries to any identity provider.

**Use the product's integration notes, permission module and member home.** Integration notes hold dated provider configuration: instances, settings, slugs and read-backs. The permission module maps roles to permission strings. The member home is the sign-in destination, `/dashboard` unless the product names another.

## Clerk's own skills: get them, prefer them for the API

- **Use Clerk's own skills for its API.** The set comes from the GitHub repository `clerk/skills`:
  - `clerk` (a router);
  - `clerk-setup`, `clerk-nextjs-patterns`, `clerk-custom-ui`, `clerk-orgs`, `clerk-billing`, `clerk-webhooks`, `clerk-testing`;
  - `clerk-backend-api` (browse and call the Backend API);
  - `clerk-cli`.
- **Install and vendor the skills instead of relying on API memory.** Run `npx skills add clerk/skills` with the open `skills` CLI. Vendor them into the product's skills folder so they load whenever Clerk is touched, and prefer them over training-era memory of the API.
- **Pin the skills and update them deliberately.** A `skills-lock.json` records each skill's source, its path and a content hash. `npx skills update` refreshes them on purpose.
- **Refuse vendor suggestions that contradict this skill.** These include:
  - `createRouteMatcher` path lists;
  - `<SignedIn>` and `<SignedOut>`, which Core 3 deleted;
  - `<ClerkProvider dynamic>`;
  - rebuilt sign-in screens;
  - `clerk.signIn()` in the browser suite;
  - Clerk permissions with features attached;
  - a hand-written CSP.

## The choices

1. **Verify, never decode, always behind one session seam.** Use `SessionVerifier`. Tests substitute a mock verifier when `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is absent; keyless mode is for development only. → `references/sessions-and-front-door.md § Sessions`
2. **Store Clerk ids only.** Read names and emails from Clerk at render time. Only the `workspaces` table holds a Clerk org or user id, and, where the product records authorship, one member table beside it holds the user id too (`saas-authorization`).
3. **Authorization lives with the data, not in a path list.** Clerk v7 deprecates `createRouteMatcher`, and `proxy.ts` only attaches the session. Every protected page and every action checks for itself; a check in a layout alone is not a check.
4. **Clerk's own components are the sign-in surface.** Use `<SignIn />`, `<SignUp />`, `<UserButton />`. They are dressed through `appearance`, never rebuilt.
5. **Sign-in lands on the member home, never on `/`.**
   - `signInFallbackRedirectUrl` and `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl` name the member home, and `afterSignOutUrl` is `/`.
   - The member home sends a signed-out visitor to `/sign-in` with a `redirect_url` back to itself.
   - The root `<ClerkProvider>` takes `nonce`, never `dynamic`: the root layout reads it from the request's `content-security-policy` header, the `'nonce-…'` in `script-src` (`references/sessions-and-front-door.md`).
6. **The front door reads no session.** `/` and every public page never call `auth()`, the seam or `<Show>`, and a signed-in visitor is never redirected away. The header's one button is labelled from the `__client_uat` cookie. → `references/sessions-and-front-door.md § The front door and the member home`
7. **In the organization shape, *Membership required* goes on at setup, before the first migration.** The authenticated harness then creates each test account's organization. In the individual shape, organizations stay off. → `references/organizations-and-billing.md § Organizations`
8. **Organization management is Clerk's own modal.** Never build a separate page. What it lacks goes in as a custom page inside it, whose Server Actions re-resolve the caller and recheck the permission.
9. **With Clerk Billing, plans and features live in a file the Clerk CLI applies, and a test reads each instance back against it.** The gated features are hidden from the pricing table and ride the session token, where `has()` reads them; one plan module maps them to capacities. A caller with no session that the server handles (an API token, a job) reads the subscription for the plan id and takes that plan's slugs from the plan list, never from the subscription's embedded `plan.features`; an anonymous visitor's action uses the allowance stamped on its resource (`saas-authorization`). Checkout is `<PricingTable for="organization">`, and no price is typed into application code. → `references/organizations-and-billing.md § Billing`
10. **Never attach a feature to a Clerk permission.** With billing enabled, Clerk gates permissions by feature, so a lapsed subscription silently removes a *capability* rather than a quota: a member loses permission to act in the middle of a session. Roles decide who may act, features decide how much, and they meet nowhere.
11. **The CSP comes from Clerk's middleware, never a hand-written policy.** → `references/csp-and-variables.md § The CSP header`
12. **Clerk's wording is not part of your contract.** Locate its controls by their element-key class (`.cl-<elementKey>`), never by their text.
13. **Read the gotchas before touching Clerk.** Read `references/gotchas.md`, since these can fail silently or look like a different problem:
    - a task that runs before the app;
    - Test mode as a dashboard toggle;
    - a development instance's silent `dev-browser-missing` refusal;
    - wording that is not in your tree;
    - the components Core 3 deleted;
    - the provider's `dynamic` and the server redirect that ignores `signInUrl`;
    - middleware that makes a page wait;
    - the bounce lost when members move off `/`;
    - a secret key in the publishable variable;
    - a provider-less surface linking into one that needs Clerk;
    - Clerk's menus opening behind a modal dialog, and a design token that loops through Clerk's own variable;
    - the plan tab that must match the workspace model;
    - the organization profile's navigation, hidden rather than unmounted below its breakpoint;
    - a dashboard feature's slug derived from its name, and a billing patch that moves features to Free;
    - a subscription read that carries only a plan's visible features;
    - the personal-data webhooks, and Clerk's own deletion paths;
    - production keys that refuse any host not on the instance's domain list, such as the host's default deploy subdomain, which still serves pages;
    - sign-in down while every page answers 200;
    - the production instance's DNS and legal consent.

## Setting it up, in order

**Apply every setup step on the development instance first.**

1. **Create the application.** The dashboard offers a long "Add authentication" prompt: don't paste it. In a repository it does not recognise, it scaffolds an app of its own in a subfolder (observed 2026-08). The page you want is *Configure → API keys*. Choose the sign-in methods: email, and Google if you want one-click sign-in.
2. **Set the workspace model before the first migration and billing.**
   - In the organization shape, turn *Organizations* on and set *Membership required* (the switch Clerk calls *Force organization selection*). Do it now, before the first migration and before billing.
   - In the individual shape, leave *Organizations* off.
   - **Turn off Clerk's own deletion paths.** Keep them off until the product can delete what a workspace owns. This covers an admin deleting an organization and a user deleting their own account. → `references/organizations-and-billing.md § Webhooks and personal data`
3. **Configure a second role only when the organization-shaped product has one.**
   - In *Configure → Organizations → Roles*, edit the default Member role and rename it, name and key, to the product's second role (for example `org:moderator`). A product whose second role is a plain member keeps `org:member`.
   - Leave Admin (`org:admin`) alone: Clerk gives it to whoever creates an organization, and an instance cannot be without it.
   - Define no Clerk permissions.
4. **Enable Test mode before running the authenticated browser suite.** Use *Configure → Instance → Test mode*: on.
   - Change the default verification code: it is the password to every test account on the instance.
   - Create one user with a `+clerk_test` address by hand, the fastest proof that Test mode is really on. → `references/authenticated-mile.md`

**The agent can make three setup changes through the Backend API.** For steps 2–4, it can use development's secret key and get read-backs the dashboard does not give. Clerk's Backend API spec was read `2026-11-02` (spec of `2026-08-20`):

- the admin's deletion path: `PATCH /v1/instance/organization_settings` with `admin_delete_enabled: false`, read back with `GET` on the same path;
- the second role: `PATCH /v1/organization_roles/{id}` with its new `name` and `key` (the key starts with `org:`, and a new key carries over to the organization settings where the role is the creator's or the default), read back with `GET /v1/organization_roles`;
- test mode: `PATCH /v1/instance` with `test_mode: true`. No `GET` returns it, so the `+clerk_test` user above is its proof.

The rest stays the owner's, in the dashboard.

5. **Configure billing only when the product bills, after organizations.** Use Free and one paid plan for organizations, written in a billing file (its `plans` block included) and applied in two commands: `npx clerk config patch --file <file> --dry-run`, read what it would send, then the same without `--dry-run`. *Manage billing* goes to the admin role alone. → `references/organizations-and-billing.md § Billing`
6. **Enable legal consent once the legal pages are live.** Use *Configure → Legal → Require express consent to legal documents*, with their URLs. The sign-up form then carries the consent checkbox.
7. **Configure OAuth application settings only for an MCP server.** See § MCP OAuth.
8. **Configure production's own instance at go-live.** It gets:
   - its own keys, which work only on the domains the instance is configured for, and its DNS records;
   - its own OAuth client for each social sign-in (development borrows Clerk's shared ones);
   - legal consent on;
   - a real Stripe account connected to Clerk Billing, and the billing file applied with the same two commands plus `--instance prod`, the dry run read first, when the product bills;
   - every dashboard setting above applied again and read back. An instance cloned from development drops the settings only the API sets (observed `2026-10-24`);
   - generated secrets generated afresh, never copied from development.

   → `references/csp-and-variables.md § The production instance`; the release around it is `release-gate`.

## Keep a record of every dashboard setting

**Record dated read-backs for settings and screenshots only where unreadable.** None lives in application code, and several silently change what that code may do. Put each in the integration notes:

- the plans and features: the billing file, and each instance's read-back against it (§ The choices, 9);
- the organization settings, `GET /v1/instance/organization_settings` with that instance's secret key: *Membership required*, automatic first organization, admin deletion off;
- the OAuth settings, `GET /v1/instance/oauth_application_settings` (§ MCP OAuth);
- sign-in methods, legal consent, self-deletion and social providers, from the instance's public settings, `GET https://<frontend API host>/v1/environment`, which needs no key;
- a screenshot for the rest: *Roles* (each role's name and key, and who holds *Manage billing*), *Test mode* on (development only), *Webhooks* (the endpoint and its events, once the personal-data trigger fires).

`npx clerk config pull --instance <dev|prod>` prints an instance's configuration as JSON as well (Clerk CLI 4.0.0, read `2026-10-25`). **A screenshot records intended configuration, not the live value.** Read the live value back before relying on it.

## MCP OAuth

**Apply these OAuth settings only for a member-authenticated MCP server.** Outside agents must reach it as signed-in members, with Clerk as authorization server. This section holds only Clerk settings. Apply `mcp-server` for callers, the route, limits, tools, directories, clients and package. That skill also covers agent-started sign-up through *Create first organization automatically*, an organization setting rather than an OAuth one.

Use *OAuth applications → Settings* (observed `2026-10-06`); these settings can fail silently.

- **Create no OAuth application by hand.** MCP clients register themselves (DCR) or identify by a metadata URL (CIMD). Clerk says a DCR client appears under *OAuth applications → Applications* after its first sign-in. A CIMD client may not appear at all (Backend API observed `2026-10-27`; the dashboard was not checked). A manual application is only for a client that can do neither. It needs the consent screen on and the same scopes, because instance defaults do not rewrite its scopes.
- **Enable CIMD support and admit any compatible CIMD client.** Set Client admission to *Any compatible CIMD client*. That is `client_id_metadata_documents_advertised` `true`, with `client_id_metadata_documents_only_allow_pre_registered_clients` and `client_id_metadata_documents_block_implicitly_allowed_clients` both `false`. When the switch goes on, the dashboard preselects *pre-registered and previously connected clients*, which refuses every new client.
- **Enable published DCR support even though Clerk labels it deprecated.** Set `dynamic_oauth_client_registration` on; Clerk labels it *Deprecated*. Many MCP clients still register only through DCR.
- **Set default scopes for identity and, where applicable, organizations.** Use `openid`, `profile`, `email`, plus `user:org:read` in the organization shape.
  - Without `user:org:read`, the consent screen asks for no organization, and every connection is refused `organization_required`.
  - The dashboard shows `offline_access` and will not remove it. It is not stored in `default_scopes`, and it only lets a client that asks for it refresh. ChatGPT asks for it (observed `2026-10-27`).
- **Require PKCE.** Turn `pkce_required` on.
- **Enable JWT access tokens and include the audience.** Turn on `oauth_jwt_access_tokens` and *Include Audience* (`aud_claim_enabled`, off by default).
  - The route requires its own exact URL as the resource in `aud`: `<APP_URL>/api/mcp` by default, or the path the product chose instead (one product mounts it at `/mcp`).
  - The protected-resource metadata describes that path, never the origin root.
- **Apply, then re-read.** Use `PATCH`, then `GET /v1/instance/oauth_application_settings`, with that instance's own secret key. Record the re-read in the integration notes: development and production separately, dated.
- **An instance cloned from development does not carry these settings.** (Observed `2026-10-24`.) Apply and re-read them on the clone as on any new instance.
- **No new environment variable.** The publishable key gives the issuer, the secret key verifies tokens and reads membership, and `APP_URL` gives the resource and the discovery URLs.

**Allow for all four OAuth verification behaviours in the route.**

- **Discovery's `claims_supported` is not the shape of the JWT Clerk emits.** The list omits `client_id` and `scope`, which a real grant can carry. Run a real DCR + PKCE grant before changing which claims the route requires.
- **A JWKS or network failure while verifying is a retryable `503`, never an invalid-token `401`.** A `401` sends the client back through the whole OAuth flow.
- **An unknown `kid` never reaches Clerk's verifier.** Given a `kid` it has not cached, `verifyToken` fetches the JWKS from the Backend API with the secret key, and an unauthenticated caller chooses the `kid`. Check the unverified header's `kid` against the key list last loaded, refresh that list at most once a minute, and refuse the rest as invalid.
- **Offline JWT verification does not see a revoked grant until the token expires.** It remains unseen until token expiry, a day by default. Recheck workspace access on every request through `requireWorkspaceAccess`, never from the token's claims alone.

Each rule's origin, the case that taught it, is in `receipts.md` beside this file; read it when a rule's edge is unclear.

## How you can tell it worked

A new user signs up on a phone against production and lands where they should, in the right organization and role. The served pages carry the production publishable key.

## Files

| File | Holds | Read when |
|---|---|---|
| `references/sessions-and-front-door.md` | the session seam; ids only; the sign-in surface and redirects; the front door and the member home: the rule, its shape on this stack, what was rejected, the tests that pin it | adding sign-in; touching the root layout, a public page, the member home or a redirect |
| `references/organizations-and-billing.md` | organizations and the choose-organization task; roles and *Manage billing*; the organization modal and custom pages; Clerk Billing: the billing file and the CLI, in code (callers with no session included) and in tests; pricing; webhooks, personal data and Clerk's own deletion paths | adding organizations, a role, a plan, a limit, pricing or a deletion webhook |
| `references/csp-and-variables.md` | the nonce CSP and static headers; every Clerk variable and the env schema's Clerk checks; what to record; the production instance | adding a CSP or a third-party origin; adding or checking a Clerk key; going live |

| `references/gotchas.md` | every Clerk gotcha, each with its symptom and receipt | before touching Clerk; when sign-in or an authenticated action seems to do nothing |

## When something is learned

- **Keep general Clerk lessons here with their receipts.** Include the date, what happened, the product named by kind.
- **Date what Clerk did or required.** Use "observed 2026-10", because the dashboard and its labels change without notice. When one changes, correct the line; never leave the old one beside the new.
- **Keep product-specific facts in its own integration notes.** This includes its instances, roles, slugs, confirmations and re-reads.
