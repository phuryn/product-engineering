# The design skill collections

Six collections, each with a stage where it leads (`SKILL.md § Which collection leads, stage by stage`). For each, this file gives:
- what it is;
- what to take from it, distilled so the checklist works without installing it;
- what to keep out;
- how to get it.

**Over all of them: the kit binds and the collections advise.** A suggestion reaches code only as a token or a primitive in the kit, recorded in the kit README. Where a collection disagrees with `method.md`, the method wins. Where two collections disagree, § Where they disagree says which side this skill takes.

The three third-party collections were read at their source on `2026-10-22`. Paths in brackets are inside each repository, so a claim can be checked. They change often, so re-read one before relying on a detail that matters.

## `frontend-design` (Anthropic): direction, always on

**What it is.** A design lead's brief: make choices specific to this subject, not the defaults any similar page would get. ([anthropics/claude-plugins-official](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/frontend-design).) Enable it in the product's committed settings so every checkout has it (§ How a product gets them).

**It leads when there is no look yet, or the look is the problem.** That means the first directions put to the owner before any screen is built, a public page whose job is to persuade (the front door, pricing), and a surface someone has called generic or templated. Once a direction is picked it stops leading: a new screen composes the kit rather than getting a direction of its own.

**Take:**
- **Ground it in the subject.**
  - Name the subject, the audience and the design's one job.
  - Distinctive choices come from the subject's own world: its materials, its vernacular, its real units.
- **Plan, review the plan, then build.**
  - The plan: a palette of 4–6 named values, the typefaces and their roles, a layout concept (wireframes to compare), and the principles.
  - Before building, revise any part that reads like the default you would produce for any similar page, and say what changed.
- **The tells of generated design.** These are defaults, not choices; don't spend free choices on them:
  - warm cream with a serif display and a terracotta accent;
  - near-black with one acid accent;
  - broadsheet hairlines with zero radius;
  - the SaaS card kit: identical rounded cards with one radius and one soft shadow, and gradient washes;
  - template chrome: tracked all-caps eyebrows above every heading, meta strings joined with middle dots, "WORD — fragment" labels, tinted near-black standing in for black, mono for small data labels, a `→` appended to links.
- **Type.**
  - One family or two, and if two, clearly distinct. A set scale.
  - Lines under 80 characters.
  - No single accented word in a headline, no all-caps labels, no labels nobody needed above content.
- **Structure encodes information.** Number things only when they are a real sequence.
- **Motion is rare.**
  - One orchestrated moment beats an entrance on every section.
  - Motion that answers a person's action (opening, expanding, confirming) is welcome.
  - Reduced motion is respected.
- **Restraint.** Spend boldness in one place, and remove one accessory before calling it done.
- **Words.**
  - Name things in the person's terms, not the system's.
  - Use active voice, and make a button say what happens.
  - An action keeps its name through the flow ("Publish" → "Published").
  - An error says what happened and how to fix it, and never apologises.
  - An empty screen is an invitation to act.
  - Sentence case.

**Keep out.** Nothing to strip, but its boldness is for direction. On a screen people work in, Taste and the method lead.

## UI/UX Pro Max: candidates for a "which one"

**What it is.** A searchable local catalogue, rather than a point of view. It has:
- 79 styles;
- 192 product profiles with palettes and font pairings;
- chart types;
- about 120 UX rules;
- rules for 22 stacks.

A Python script queries it and can also generate a whole design system. ([nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill](https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill), MIT.)

**It leads when a decision needs options to choose between.** Examples: a palette for a second direction, a chart for a kind of data, or a stack's form-validation convention. Take the pick into the kit by hand. Its pre-delivery checklist is a quick pass before Impeccable's audit.

**Take** (its `references/quick-reference.md`, `data/ux-guidelines.csv`, `data/stacks/html-tailwind.csv`):
- **Contrast and touch.**
  - Text 4.5:1, large text 3:1.
  - Meaningful icons and control boundaries 3:1.
  - Focus rings 2–4px, at 3:1 against their surroundings.
  - Sticky bars and overlays never hide the focused control.
  - Targets: the method's 44px (WCAG 2.2's floor is 24 × 24), with 8px between touch targets.
  - Every drag has a single-pointer and a keyboard alternative.
  - Sign-in allows password managers and paste.
  - A changed count is announced as a whole phrase (`<span role="status" aria-atomic="true">3 items in cart</span>`), never a bare number.
- **Forms.**
  - Every field has a visible label; a placeholder is not one.
  - An error sits below its field, linked with `aria-describedby`.
  - After a failed submit, focus goes to a linked error summary while the inline errors stay.
  - Validate on blur, not on every keystroke.
  - An error names the cause and the fix.
  - Read-only looks different from disabled.
  - Bulk deletes can be undone.
  - Closing a sheet with unsaved changes asks first.
  - Toasts are `aria-live="polite"` and never take focus.
- **Layout.**
  - Never disable zoom.
  - `min-h-dvh`, not `100vh`.
  - One z-index scale, never `z-[9999]`.
  - Body text 16px or more on phones.
  - Tabular figures for data, prices and timers.
- **Navigation.**
  - The current item is visibly marked: neutral, per the method.
  - Breadcrumbs from three levels deep.
  - Back restores scroll, filters and input.
  - After a route change, focus moves to the main content.
  - Destructive items sit apart from the rest.
  - An unavailable destination says why instead of disappearing.
- **Charts.**
  - A table alternative.
  - No pie above five categories.
  - Marks 3:1 against the background, labels 4.5:1.
  - Empty, loading and error states.
  - Locale-aware numbers, and the time granularity labelled.
  - Sortable tables expose `aria-sort`.
- **Tailwind and Next.js.**
  - Complete class names, never interpolated ones (`` `bg-${c}-500` ``).
  - Colours declared in the theme and used by role (`bg-primary`), not by arbitrary value.
  - `text-balance` on headings, never a hand-placed `<br>`.
- **Retheming an existing product.**
  1. Audit the hard-coded values.
  2. Map each to a semantic role: background, surface, foreground, primary, border, ring.
  3. Migrate in small batches.
  4. After each batch, check contrast, states and both themes.

  In its words: "add missing tokens rather than creating a parallel theme system."

**Keep out:**
- **A second design system.** `--persist` writes `design-system/<project>/MASTER.md` and per-page overrides. The `uipro init` CLI copies its files into the repository.
- **The plugin installs every skill in its repository** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` points at the whole `.claude/skills/`), not only this one:
  - `brand`, which writes brand docs and design-token files;
  - `design-system`, which downloads stock images;
  - `design`, which generates logos through external image APIs and tells the agent to fix failing scripts itself;
  - `ui-styling`, which ships shadcn scripts and fonts.

  Use only `ui-ux-pro-max`.
- **Its generated palettes are raw hex** and its product profiles are generic. For example, "SaaS" maps to glassmorphism, which the other two collections ban. Treat a palette as a candidate to measure with `scripts/color.py`, never a decision.
- **Its truncation rules:** ellipsis with a tooltip, `truncate`, `line-clamp`. The method refuses them; keep its wrapping rules, which match ours.
- **`references/pro-rules.md`** is scoped to native mobile apps by its own notice.

**Get it.** In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill
/plugin install ui-ux-pro-max@ui-ux-pro-max-skill
```

It needs Python 3 (standard library only), and the search makes no network calls.

## Taste (`design-taste-frontend`): screens people work in

**What it is.** Art direction against the average generated screen. It has:
- a house style that bans the common tells;
- a script that deals researched directions;
- a real-browser inspector;
- a screenshot-critique loop;
- a chapter for app screens drawn from 23 measured product screens.

([Leonxlnx/taste-skill](https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill), MIT.)

**It leads on screens people work in:** dashboards, admin, tables and lists, settings. Use its app-screen run (`skills/taste-skill/references/app-screens.md`), not its page run. With a kit in place, run its draw with `--keep palette,type`: the kit is the style.

**Take** (`app-screens.md` unless named):
- **The screen's one question.**
  - Write it in one line. The biggest block answers it, and the largest figure answers the title row's sentence.
  - The screen's one finding goes under the title.
  - The most frequent job is one click from the first screen.
  - At 1440 × 900, every block shows its header and first rows. Cap lists at 4–6 rows, with "View all".
- **Data that tells the truth.**
  - Totals are computed from the rows.
  - A change is the difference of the two values as displayed.
  - Every relative figure names its baseline ("vs prior 30 days").
  - A fact shown twice is one variable (the method's *one function per state summary*).
  - No lorem, "Acme" or vanity totals.
- **Shell.**
  - Product mark and name at the top, with the workspace as a switcher.
  - A sidebar about 230px wide.
  - The current item is a neutral grey pill on light screens, brighter text on dark.
  - Group labels in sentence case, never uppercase.
  - Counts only on queues that need action.
  - Never a dark or saturated sidebar on a light screen.
- **Canvas.**
  - One gutter value both ways, and one left edge from header to last row.
  - Cards in a row share a bottom edge.
  - Column count follows item count: no orphan cells, no stretched empty cards.
  - Narrow tables (five columns or fewer) run about 760px wide, not the full canvas.
  - One h1, a noun rather than a greeting.
- **Counts and KPIs.**
  - One container split by 1px dividers beats separate tiles. No icon circles.
  - The answer figure is at least 1.3× its siblings.
  - A delta names its window in words.
  - Colour means good or bad, not up or down: rising latency is red.
  - A zero or undefined change is grey; a change from zero reads "+4 (new)".
- **Charts** (with `dataviz` leading).
  - One series per chart, three at most.
  - Faint gridlines and no y-axis line.
  - Round ticks, with the top tick above the maximum.
  - x-labels never rotated.
  - No smoothing.
  - Annotate a spike about 3× the usual change.
  - Forecasts dashed.
  - One subject keeps one hue.
- **Tables.**
  - Rows 36–53px; headers grey and sentence case.
  - No zebra stripes, no header band.
  - Numbers right-aligned in tabular figures, with fixed decimals per metric.
  - A sign on every change.
  - A missing value is a grey dash; a real zero is printed.
  - A full list states its total ("1–50 of 1,284").
  - A status pill is a pale tint with dark text of the same hue, and it never wraps.
- **Forms and settings.**
  - Label above the field; no floating labels.
  - One control height per context.
  - A disabled control stays legible and says why.
  - Destructive actions go last, in their own section, naming the object.
  - One save model per view.
- **Type and colour.**
  - Check that `tabular-nums` really changes the face's digit widths.
  - Every text tier, placeholders included, reaches 4.5:1.
  - Radii either tight (4–8px) or soft (16–24px), and nested radii step down.
  - Roughly 3% of pixels coloured: the accent on data plus at most one control.
- **States.**
  - Loading is the final layout, with flat placeholders at their real size and no layout shift.
  - An error stays inside the block that failed, says when the data was last good, and offers Retry.
  - An empty block keeps its frame and header, with one sentence across it.
- **Phone.**
  - A sidebar wider than 30% of the phone fails. Navigation folds into a top bar with a sheet, or a bottom bar of 4–5 items.
  - Below about 640px, a table becomes two-line rows: fields move to line 2 and are never dropped. Or it scrolls inside its own frame with the first column fixed.
- **Its screenshot critique**, the per-screen pass:
  1. Capture at 1440, 768 and 390.
  2. Answer in writing:
     - Is the biggest thing the answer?
     - Do the edges line up?
     - Is colour only on data and status?
     - Do the numbers add up and align?
     - Do zeros and dashes read right?
     - Do legend swatches match their marks?
     - Does the phone layout fold correctly?
  3. Fix the worst three, then look again.

  Three rounds at most. "If a problem shows in a screenshot, it is real, whatever the code says."

**Keep out:**
- **Its page run**: four real pictures, a floor of eight moving elements, image-archive searches, and half an hour and hundreds of thousands of tokens per build.
- **Its files and tokens.**
  - Don't copy in `assets/app.css`, `base.css` or the scene files. They bring a second token vocabulary.
  - Keep `.taste-skill/` (working files and screenshots) out of commits.
  - `assets.mjs --get` downloads images into `assets/`.
- **Its truncation** (§7.4: ellipsis on one line, IDs cut to about 8 characters). The method refuses it.
- **Its bans that its author labels taste, not evidence** (`SKILL.md`, "Why these, honestly"): violet and indigo, monospace, hairlines, index numbers. The method has its own rules for mono and numbering; the rest is the product's call.
- **"A border or a shadow, never both."** That's taste. The owner approved a faint resting shadow under bordered panels for a monitoring product (`2026-10-22`), as Supabase does.
- **"Toggle on is green or near-black."** On a product whose job is to report health, green is a state, so a toggle is never green there (the method: action and state never share a colour).

**Get it:**

```
npx skills add https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill --skill "design-taste-frontend"
```

Or use its Claude Code or Codex plugin. Its inspector needs Node 22+ and an installed Chrome, Edge or Chromium; its other scripts need Node 18+. It needs no API keys and no hooks, and goes on the network only for pictures.

## Impeccable: audit and harden before it ships

**What it is.** One skill with 24 commands, backed by a 61-rule deterministic detector that also runs as an edit hook. ([pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable), Apache-2.0.)

**It leads on a screen that works, before the release.** Run its audit, then harden, then polish, and fix what it finds inside the kit.

**Take:**
- **The audit** (`reference/audit.md`).
  - Five dimensions, each scored 0–4:
    - accessibility;
    - performance;
    - theming: hard-coded colours, broken dark mode, values that don't follow the theme;
    - responsive: fixed widths, small targets, sideways scroll, text scaling;
    - implementation integrity.
  - Bands out of 20: 18+ excellent, 14+ good, 10+ acceptable, 6+ poor, below 6 critical.
  - Every finding names its severity, its location (`file:line`), its impact, the standard it breaks and the fix.
  - Never report a finding you haven't verified.
- **Severity for design findings.**
  - **P0** blocks the task: fix now.
  - **P1** causes significant difficulty or breaks WCAG AA: fix before release.
  - **P2** is an annoyance with a workaround: fix next pass.
  - **P3** is polish.

  Tie-break: *would a person contact support about this?* If yes, it's at least P1. (Code findings keep the independent review's own scale.)
- **The critique** (`reference/critique.md`).
  - Nielsen's ten heuristics, each 0–4. Most real interfaces score 20–32 of 40.
  - At most four visible options at a decision point.
  - Personas for dashboards: the impatient power user and the screen-reader-and-keyboard user.
  - The critique is written before any detector output is read, the same unsteered principle as the code review.
- **Harden** (`reference/harden.md`).
  - Test inputs:
    - 100+ character names;
    - empty and one-character text;
    - emoji, right-to-left, CJK and accented text;
    - millions and billions;
    - 1,000+ items, and 50+ options.
  - Each API failure has its own state: 400 shows validation, 401 goes to sign-in, 403 is a permission state, 404 a not-found, 429 a rate limit, 500 a generic error with a way to get help.
  - Leave 30–40% room for translated text.
  - Use CSS logical properties, `Intl` number and date formats, and plurals from a library, never `count !== 1`.
  - Click submit ten times fast.
  - Keep what the person typed when an error occurs.
  - One failed component never blocks the whole screen.
  - Zoom to 200%.
  - An interrupted gesture clears its drag state.
- **Polish** (`reference/polish.md`).
  - First, classify each drift: a missing token, a one-off, a conceptual mismatch, or a local defect.
  - Then fix in order:
    1. broken tasks and inaccessible paths;
    2. missing states;
    3. flow, responsive and kit drift;
    4. visual and motion inconsistencies;
    5. code cleanup.
  - Every control has default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error and success behaviour.
  - "Promote genuinely reusable values to tokens; do not create a system abstraction for one local exception."
  - End by reading your own diff for churn and leftovers.
- **The craft floor** (`reference/craft-floor.md`).
  - Body and placeholder text at 4.5:1.
  - On a coloured surface, tint secondary text from the surface's hue, never plain grey.
  - More space above a heading than below it.
  - Theme the browser's own surfaces: text selection, caret, scrollbars, focus ring, underline offset.
  - Refuse:
    - nested cards;
    - eyebrow labels;
    - gradient text;
    - a coloured side border over 1px on a card;
    - decorative glass;
    - sparklines standing in for content;
    - emoji or glyphs as icons;
    - a modal for a task that needs neither interruption nor protected focus.
- **App screens** (`reference/operate.md`).
  - A fixed rem type scale, not a fluid `clamp()`.
  - Transitions of 150–250ms, and no page-load choreography.
  - Placeholders at real size, not spinners in the middle of content.
  - Overlays escape `overflow` (native `<dialog>` or popover).
  - "If the 'save' button looks different in two places, one is wrong."
- **Words** (`reference/clarify.md`).
  - An error says what failed, why when known, and how to recover. No internal codes as the message.
  - A confirmation names its action, never Yes, OK or Submit; prefer undo where recovery is safe.
  - Empty states tell apart first use, no results, filtered out, no permission and failure.
- **Detector rules worth checking by hand:**
  - side tabs;
  - nested cards;
  - grey text on colour;
  - lines over about 80 characters;
  - body text closer than 16px to the viewport edge;
  - leading under 1.3;
  - skipped heading levels;
  - text under 12px;
  - tracking over 0.05em on body text;
  - the same text repeated across containers.

**Keep out:**
- **Its hooks.** `npx impeccable install` adds edit and stop hooks to `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.codex/hooks.json` and other harnesses' files. Its README warns that Claude Code hooks "run independently of model-tool approval". Its launcher fetches a pinned binary into `~/.impeccable/bin/` on first use.
- **Its second design system.** `init`, `document` and `extract` write `PRODUCT.md`, a root `DESIGN.md` and `.impeccable/`, and some detector rules enforce `DESIGN.md`, not the kit. Don't redesign through it either.
- **Network and telemetry.** Starting a new design always asks its roll API at impeccable.style. Telemetry is on unless you opt out: `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, `IMPECCABLE_NO_TELEMETRY=1`, or `"telemetry": false` in `.impeccable/config.json`.
- **Live mode,** which runs a `package.json` script in a shell.
- **Its truncation recipes** (`.truncate`, `-webkit-line-clamp`, the first in `harden.md`). The method refuses them: text a person typed wraps.
- **Its allowance for "a coloured rail or header, a tinted ground"** (`mode-operate.md`). It contradicts its own `operate.md` and the method's *the accent acts*.

**Get it.** Its install adds the hooks above, which is the owner's call on each machine. Without it, the checklists above are the audit: read its `reference/` files for the full text.

## `dataviz` (built into Claude Code): charts

**What it is.** A method for charts with a runnable palette validator, built into Claude Code.

**It leads whenever a chart, a stat tile or a KPI row is drawn.**

**Take.** Its procedure, in order:
1. Pick the form first: sometimes the answer is a stat, not a chart.
2. Assign colour by its job: categorical, sequential, diverging or status.
3. Run the validator, never eyeball it.
4. Apply the mark specs.
5. Add hover by default.
6. Do the accessibility pass.
7. Look at the render.

Its non-negotiables:
- categorical hues in a fixed order, never cycled;
- one axis, never two;
- colour follows the entity, not its rank;
- status colours reserved for status;
- text in text tokens, never the series colour;
- a legend for two or more series.

**Keep out.** Nothing, but a builder outside Claude Code never sees it. When a product has charts, write the chart rules it needs into the kit README.

## `artifact-design` (built into Claude Code): pages published as claude.ai artifacts

**It leads only for a page published as an artifact**, such as a review's specimens or a report for the owner. Never for the product's own UI, which the product's kit governs.

## Where they disagree, and the side this skill takes

| Question | They say | This skill |
|---|---|---|
| Glass | Pro Max recommends it for SaaS; Taste and Impeccable ban it | no |
| Colour in the chrome | Taste: on data and status, never a saturated sidebar; Impeccable's app mode allows a coloured rail | neutral chrome; the accent acts (method) |
| Truncation | all three offer ellipsis or line-clamp | refused: text a person typed wraps, and the kit test refuses truncation (method) |
| Dark neutrals | Taste: true neutral; Impeccable: always tinted | the kit decides, measured with `scripts/color.py`, recorded in the kit README |
| Fonts | Impeccable flags Inter, Roboto and Geist; Taste defaults to Inter | the kit decides; `frontend-design`'s *choose deliberately* applies |
| Loading | Pro Max allows shimmer; Taste doesn't | placeholders at real size with no layout shift (all three agree); shimmer is taste, and honours reduced motion if used |
| Widths | Pro Max 375/768/1024/1440; Taste 390/768/1440; Impeccable 640/768/1024 | the product's capture and assertion widths (`screens.md § What to verify visually`); theirs are advice |
| Severity | three different scales | Impeccable's P0–P3 for design findings; code keeps the review's own |
| Weight as emphasis | Taste and Pro Max use weight for hierarchy | hierarchy yes, but never as a second signal for state (owner's preference, `SKILL.md`) |

## How a product gets them

- **`frontend-design`**: enable it in the product's committed `.claude/settings.json` as `frontend-design@claude-plugins-official`. Anthropic's own marketplace, which Claude Code adds by itself in an interactive session, lists it by a relative path, so a fresh checkout loads it once the folder is trusted, with no install step. A machine that also has it at user scope from another source (`@anthropic-plugin-directory`, `@synced`) may list it twice; uninstall that one.
- **This skill** is copied into the product at `.claude/skills/design/` (`SKILL.md § Where the copies live`).
- **`dataviz` and `artifact-design`** ship with Claude Code.
- **The three third-party collections** are linked above, installed per machine from their own READMEs, and used when present. Don't vendor or enable them in the product's repository: registering a third-party marketplace for every checkout, and a plugin whose launcher downloads a binary and installs hooks, is the owner's call on each machine. Without them, design from the method, `frontend-design` and the checklists in this file.
