# MCP server

**Build the remote MCP server and prove it before listing it.** This skill covers serving outside agents and getting listed without relearning the same lessons. Its examples use Next.js, Supabase, Clerk and Netlify.

**Keep product-specific facts in that product's own records.** This skill names those records by what they hold:

- The API contract: every REST route and MCP tool, what it accepts, returns and refuses;
- The distribution record: one row per listing (directory, registry, package), with its state, its date and how it is updated, and each client verified, with the date and what was called;
- The decision log: dated decisions that had real options, each with its reopen trigger;
- The backlog: deferred work, each item with the trigger that reopens it.

**Read `clerk-production` § MCP OAuth before writing the route.** Clerk's settings are there, not here; this skill does not repeat them. Allow for four behaviours: discovery lists differ from token shape, verifier outages return `503`, unknown `kid` values are refused before Clerk, and revocation remains unseen until expiry.

## What binds, in order

1. **Apply `saas-authorization` first because a tool is a route.** Its caller is resolved by the three functions, deterministic code decides what it may do, and everything it returns that a person wrote is untrusted text.
2. **Apply and reread every Clerk OAuth setting per instance.** Apply `clerk-production` § MCP OAuth.
3. **Apply this skill to the server and its distribution.** It covers tools, directories, clients and the package.
4. **Let each directory's current page override this skill.** They change without notice: read them again before every submission, and record the date you read them. Where this skill and a directory's page disagree, the page wins and this skill gets a dated correction.

## Decide these first, in the product's decision log

**Record these decisions before building the server or its tools.** Use the product's decision log.

| Decision | The default | The other choice, and what it costs | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Does anything answer without sign-in? | **Authenticate every call, including `initialize`, by default.** Use Clerk OAuth or a workspace API token | An anonymous surface buys users who have no account, such as a ChatGPT plugin that makes a room with no sign-up. It costs a new kind of caller, an identity only the platform can vouch for, limits and a lifetime of its own, a disclosure burden, and in OpenAI's directory a package that declares it before the first upload. | `references/server.md § Who may call it` · the `chatgpt-plugin` skill |
| Who may connect? | An admitted OAuth caller gets the full grant a new API token carries, so admit by the permission that mints such a token, checked through the three functions on every call | A role compared by name, or a neighbouring permission the same role happens to hold today, hands write to whichever role is given that permission later. A caller without the permission gets a clear `403`, never a narrower connection | `references/server.md § Who may call it` |
| What must an agent never do? | A written list, held in code, and said in the instructions and the README | Examples: an audience product's agents cannot ask, vote or delete; a monitoring product's cannot delete, change billing, manage tokens or publish an incident note | `references/tools.md § Choosing the tools` |
| Must a sign-up that starts in an agent work? | Yes, for a product whose first user may arrive through an agent | Refusing the first call until the dashboard has been opened sends that user out of the agent; a Clerk setting and a workspace made on the first authenticated call close the gap | `references/server.md § The first call` |
| The path | `/api/mcp` or `/mcp`, chosen once | The OAuth audience and both protected-resource documents (the path's own and the root alias) name that exact URL, and the `401` challenge points at the path's own document; the authorization-server document stays Clerk's, relayed | `references/server.md § The route` |

## The rules every change meets

- **Descriptions, titles and the server's instructions are product copy, and each sentence is a claim.** Directories score them and show them; agents choose tools from them alone. Review them like code, since a sentence can promise behaviour the handlers do not keep. `references/tools.md`.
- **Every argument has a description and every tool an `outputSchema`, and a test holds both against the real handlers.** Smithery scores each out of 10 (observed `2026-10`). `references/tools.md § The tests`.
- **Every tool carries a `title` and the hints a directory requires.** Claude's directory flags tools lacking a title and `readOnlyHint` or `destructiveHint` (observed `2026-10`). OpenAI's guidelines keep an action destructive even when another tool can undo it (read `2026-10-26`). `references/tools.md § Annotations`.
- **`tools/list` has a size budget.** Pin it in a test. Every client loads it into the model's context, so per-field descriptions can expand it.
- **Log every call, refused ones included, before the server is listed anywhere.** It is the only way to learn which clients and directories actually call you. `references/server.md § The per-call log`.
- **A client is supported only once a happy path with it is recorded.** Record the date, the client and what was called, by this product and against this product. A client another product verified, or someone reports working, is unverified for you. `references/clients.md`.
- **Update the package and directories after promoting a tool-surface change.** A description or schema change is a surface change. Otherwise the package can differ from the hosted surface directories scored. `references/companion-repo.md § After a product release`.
- **Everything is published from the owner's account.** The registry namespace comes from the GitHub login that publishes, and a listing's maintainer is whoever claimed it; check which account the CLI is logged in as before any listing (`gh api user --jq .login`).

## The stage, in order

1. **REST functions first.** MCP and REST call the same module, so the two can never disagree about what a call does. REST stays token-only; OAuth is for MCP clients.
2. **Build a stateless Streamable HTTP route with the required controls.** Include stateless Streamable HTTP, the challenge, the three layers of error, the limits, the log (`references/server.md`).
3. **Build the tools with both required tests.** Read `references/tools.md`.
4. **Configure OAuth, then prove a real grant and client.** Apply `clerk-production` § MCP OAuth, then `references/server.md § Proving it` for the automated real grant and real client.
5. **Write the API contract, public developer page and distribution record.** Include the API contract, a public page for developers pinned to the code by a test, and the distribution record.
6. **Release with independent review of the whole release.** Apply `independent-review`; descriptions and instructions are in the subject, not context.
7. **Publish listings and the package from production after promotion.** Read `references/directories.md` and `references/companion-repo.md`; apply `chatgpt-plugin` for a ChatGPT plugin.

Each rule's origin, the case that taught it, is in `receipts.md` beside this file; read it when a rule's edge is unclear.

## How you can tell it worked

A real client connects to the deployed server, signs in, lists the tools and calls one as a member, and the tests cover each tool's permission check.

## Files

| File | Holds | Read when |
|---|---|---|
| `references/server.md` | who may call it, and what an anonymous surface costs; the first call of an agent-first sign-up; the route, its errors and transport; limits; the per-call log; proving it works | building or changing the route, its auth or its limits; deciding on an anonymous surface |
| `references/tools.md` | naming; choosing the tools; descriptions, arguments, results, output schemas, annotations, the server's instructions; the two tests | adding or changing any tool, or the instructions |
| `references/directories.md` | each directory and registry: what it lists, requires, scores or refuses, and how a listing is kept current | listing the server, answering a review, rescanning after a change |
| `references/clients.md` | each client: how it connects, what to verify, what is known about it | writing setup instructions, or saying which clients work |
| `references/companion-repo.md` | the public repository and the stdio package: layout, README, the package's rules, one version everywhere, the release procedure, what a product release owes it | creating the repository, changing the package, releasing it |

## When something is learned

- **This skill is general and will be published.** Write the rule and why it holds. A product appears only as an example, named by kind ("a live Q&A product"), never by its commits, release codes, file paths, listing or plugin ids, pull-request numbers or account names.
- **Date what a platform or directory did or required.** Use "read on" or "observed in", because they change without notice. When one changes, correct the line; do not leave the old one beside the new.
- **What is true of one product goes in that product's repository.** This includes its listings and their states, versions, verified clients, open reviews and receipts, in its distribution record, API contract or backlog.
- **A rule a test can hold gets the test.** Say what the test asserts, not where one product keeps it.

## Where the skill lives

- **Install the `app-stack` pack in every agent that builds the server.** Keep no product copy: it freezes at its copied version, and Claude Code loads it twice beside the pack. For an existing copy (`.claude/skills/mcp-server/`, `.agents/skills/mcp-server/`), move additions into the product's repository (above) or a change for this collection. Then delete the copy.
- **A builder that is not Claude Code has the pack installed in it too.** A Codex brief for the MCP server names the skill as `$app-stack:mcp-server`.
