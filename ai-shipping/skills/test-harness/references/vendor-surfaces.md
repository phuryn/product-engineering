# Vendor surfaces and link previews

Two kinds of surface the product does not fully render itself: a vendor's components and responses inside the product (sign-in, an organization modal, a pricing table, a billing read), and what a crawler or an unfurler makes of the page without running it (share cards, icons). Both are tested as the outside world sees them, never as the source describes them.

## A vendor's elements

- **A vendor's element keys, state classes and painted surfaces are measured from the rendered DOM — never inferred from types, docs or names.** Locators must account for live counts, actual tabs and readiness conditions. Composite alpha before comparing colours; resolve colour through the browser (a 1×1 canvas handles colour spaces), and poll past transitions. Scope contrast floors to what you set, not a vendor's own muted text. **Certified and invisible is not a fix:** ensure the active affordance survives a repaint. (`2026-09-17`, guessed Clerk locators, colour readings and a disappearing active pill each invented a different defect.)
- **A vendor's API responses are the same: a fake returns the shape the vendor actually sends, captured from a real call, never the shape its types or docs suggest.** A drill on development with the vendor's real test flow (a test-card checkout, a real webhook) finds what a fake cannot, and the fake is then rebuilt from what the drill saw. (`2026-10-23`, a monitoring product: a test-card checkout on development showed the paid plan in billing while the workspace's API calls got the free plan's limits, because the vendor's subscription read carried only a plan's publicly visible features; every test had faked a fuller response. The vendor's recipe is in `clerk-production`.)
- **A vendor's visible wording is not in your tree, so it is not part of the contract.** Locate its controls by their element-key class (on Clerk, `.cl-<elementKey>`), never by their words; the reason and receipt are in `clerk-production`.
- **A wrong measurement reaches more than one file, and the copy outside the gate is the one that ships.** When a fact proves wrong, grep the tree for what it authorized. Retargeting an assertion can repeat the mistake: check whether the colour reaches text or fill, and whether the pairing is already certified. (`2026-09-18`, a false report of signed-out pricing buttons survived in the visual suite after the gate's copy was fixed.)
- **An absence is assertable only when the surface is independently proved present** — loaded root, cards and prices — otherwise it is vacuous. The same rule holds for any "nothing found" assertion: the catalog suite's first assertion is that the product's tables exist (`rules-from-bugs.md § The database`).

## Link previews

- **The artifact nobody on the team ever looks at is the one a stranger sees first.** Link previews use the first server response, without JavaScript: **assert the raw response body, never the DOM** — `page.locator("meta")` cannot tell served from hydrated. Samples belong only on pages plainly about the product; a resource's preview must not offer another resource's identifier.
- **On Next.js, no page declares `openGraph` or `twitter`.** Next merges metadata shallowly onto the resolved object, which already holds the segment's file-based image, so a page's `openGraph` can discard it. Use `title` and `description`, file-based images per segment (`opengraph-image`, `twitter-image`), and global root fields, with a source guard that fails on a page declaring either key. `alternates.canonical` goes on each indexed page, never on the root layout. (`2026-09-18`, a pre-implementation response test caught three public cards losing their images.)
- **At a release that touched metadata**, read `og:image` off the raw production response of every public page (`release-gate`).

## Icons

- **A `200` with the right content type is not proof the artifact renders.** A standalone SVG is parsed as strict XML: a `--` inside a comment makes every browser refuse the file while the server still answers `200` with `image/svg+xml`. **Parse what you serve the way the client will** — fetch the icon the page links to and run `DOMParser` on the body, requiring no `parsererror`.
- **Require `/favicon.ico` too**, `200` with an icon content type, because search engines, bookmark tools and link unfurlers ask for it by convention. Next serves it only as a static `src/app/favicon.ico`, never from a route, so it is a checked-in binary rendered from `icon.svg` by a small script; regenerate and commit both whenever the mark changes. (`2026-09-18`, a product had no tab icon in any browser from the day its mark was drawn, while its post-deploy table recorded `/icon.svg` as *200, correct content type*.)

## Generated images

- **A generated image draws its type from disk, never from the network.** `opengraph-image`, `twitter-image` and `apple-icon` (`ImageResponse`, Satori) cannot use `next/font`'s generated assets and cannot decode WOFF2.
  - One server-only module reads the product's static WOFF or TTF files from an installed, pinned package, by explicit `node_modules/...` paths, so Next traces exactly those files into the build; it caches the promise once per process, and every `ImageResponse` passes its fonts.
  - A font fetched while a preview is being served is a network dependency on the request a crawler makes.
  - **A unit test makes `fetch` reject** and asserts it is never called and the promise is reused; **a source test** checks every image route passes the fonts.

  (`2026-09-18`, a product moved its share cards into its own typefaces.)
